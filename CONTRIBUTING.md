## 🔀 Pull Requests

PRs are encouraged, but consider starting with a feature request to temperature-check first. If the PR involves a major change to the protocol, the work should be fleshed out as an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://community.xmtp.org/t/xip-0-xip-purpose-process-guidelines/475) before work begins.

After a pull request is submitted, a single approval is required to merge it.

## 🧪 Testing

Please add unit tests when appropriate and ensure that all unit tests are passing before submitting a pull request. Note that some unit tests require a backend service to be running locally. The `./dev/up` script can be run a single time to start the service in the background using Docker.
